# Assembly-Snake

Snake game in Assembly! I took the classic snake game and implemented it (after lots of pain) in assembly. This was originally meant to be a project for Saycheese, but I never managed to make it small enough :(

The game can be run in the command line.

## Controls
- Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake.
- Press `Q` to quit the game.
